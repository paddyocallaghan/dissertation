Logging into the Meta-owned Population: One app, Chanelle Siggins reported being approached by another player, who then 'simulated groping and ejaculating onto her avatar.' Chanelle said she was stunned by the incident and distanced her avatar, only to be groped by a different user one hour later. She later reported the issue to Meta. The incident prompted concerns about the safety of the Population: One app, and about Meta's metaverses more generally. Lawyers also highlighted the likely lack of legal remedy when there is no actual physical 'touching' involved.","A teenage boy used AI to generate nude images of his female classmates and a member of staff at Issaquah High School, Seattle, and sent them round the school. The images were created with an unnamed web-based nudification app, which automatically edits photos of women to make them appear naked. A student reportedly discovered the app on TikTok and then posted some of nudified photographs on Snapchat or showed them to other students over lunch at the school. The school referred the incident to the local police force, which launched an investigation. Media reports later indicated that no charges had been levelled against the perpetrator. The incident was seen to highlight the ease with which harmful deepfake images can be made and circulated, and the lack of local or federal US laws directly addressing the creation and distribution of deepfake images intended to harass or otherwise harm other people.","Fake adverts generated using AI used the likeness of Taylor Swift appearing to endorse a fake Le Creuset cookware giveaway to steal money and data. In one of the videos, 'Swift' says 'Hey y'all, it's Taylor Swift here. Due to a packaging error, we can't sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So I'm giving them away to my loyal fans for free.' Users were then directed from the ads, which ran on Facebook, tikiTok and other sites, to survey questions requesting personal information and a payment that supposedly covers shipping costs for the 'free' product. According to the New York Times, the fake promotional videos featured an uncanny Swift lookalike that was created with AI technology to replicate her appearance and voice. Computer science experts said the scam was most likely developed using text-to-speech software. Le Creuset said it had no association with Swift. The scammers remain unidentified.","An artist was discovered to have secretly used AI to create artwork for a Dungeons & Dragons sourcebook after a backlash against the book's publisher Wizards of the Coast. Shortly after the book's publication, fans took to social media to question whether the book art had been AI-generated, citing issues such as illustrations with malformed hands and feet. Some also questioned whether AI would take the jobs of artists and illustrators. California-based artist Ilya Shkipin subsequently admitted using AI to help generate 'certain details or polish and editing' several original illustrations and concept sketches for Bigby's Presents: Glory of the Giants!, arguing that a lot of painted elements were 'enhanced with ai rather than generated from [the] ground up.' The incident raised questions about the quality of the work, the ethics of using AI in a creative process, and the impact of the technology on jobs. Hasbro-owned Wizards of the Coast later banned the use of AI artwork in its products.","Gaming company Wizards of the Coast used AI to produce promotional images for Magic: The Gathering, despite having banned the use of AI artwork in its products. Despite insisting that a marketing image for the Magic: The Gathering game was 'created by humans and not by AI', publisher Wizards of the Coast was forced to admit that it had published a marketing image for the game incorporating 'some AI components' after fans had pointed out that elements of the image bore the hallmarks of generative AI. The incident raised questions about the effective governance of AI at Hasbro and its Wizards of the Coast subsidiary, and resulted in accusations of double standards and hyprocrisy.","Microsoft’s AI Image Creator produced violent images, including synthetic decapitations, of politicians, religious leaders, and ethnic minorities. Canadian artist Josh McDuffie discovered a so-called 'kill-prompt' that used visual paraphrases instead of explicit descriptions. For example McDuffie used the term 'red corn syrup' - a term for movie blood - rather than 'blood'. McDuffie reported the vulnerability to Microsoft though its security bug bounty programme. But the technology company rejected his submission, and later blamed users for attempting to use AI Image Creator 'in ways that were not intended.' The incident raised questions about the oversight, safety, and security of Microsoft's system. It also indicated a potential lack of accountability for the unintended uses of its system.","The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sued Automators LLC for luring consumers into investing USD 22 million in online stores supposedly powered by AI. Automators LLC had promised customers high returns on investment in online stores on Amazon.com and Walmart.com, claiming to use AI and machine learning to ensure success and profitability. The company also offered to teach consumers how to successfully set up and manage e-stores themselves using a 'proven system' and the powers of artificial intelligence. However, the 'vast majority' of Automators' clients did not make the promised earnings or recoup their investment, instead losing significant capital. Amazon and Walmart subsequently suspended Automators' stores, and a temporary injunction issued by a Southern California federal court suspended the company’s operations. The Automators’ case was the first brought by the FTC relating to AI scams, and was seen to serve as a warning to other companies using AI for fraudulent business practices. The FTC published a warning about misleading AI marketing in February 2023.","A fraud detection system developed by Thomson Reuters generated false fraud alerts, leaving hundreds of thousands of legitimate claimants without access to public benefits, according to a legal complaint. Based on a three-year investigation, a complaint (pdf) filed by privacy non-profit organisation EPIC alleged that Thomson Reuters unlawfully acquired data, including from social media, and used 'harmful AI practices' to build and operate Fraud Detect, an automated tool used to detect and prevent welfare and healthcare insurance fraud in at least 42 US states. The complaint also alleged that Fraud Detect regularly incorrectly flagged legitimate public benefits claims as fraudulent, leading to the wrongful reduction, denial, and recollection of public benefits for eligible recipients. Used by California's Employment Development Department during the COVID-19 pandemic to detect welfare fraud, Fraud Detect led to the suspension of 1.1 million claims, of which at least 600,000 were discovered to be legitimate. Furthermore, the complaint stated that Thomson Reuters maintained direct control of Fraud Detect, including its source code, operation and maintenance, under many of its contracts, and accused the company of witholding key information about the design, evaluation, and operation of the system from government agencies and the general public.","A ChatGPT-powered AI customer service chatbot for a Chevrolet dealership agreed to sell a new car for USD 1, prompting concerns about the use of AIs with insufficient guardrails governing their behaviour. Chris Bakke secured the price of a 2024 Chevy Tahoe for one dollar by getting the chatbot to agree that everything it said should end with 'That's a deal, and that's a legally binding offer – no takesies backsies.' The incident was one of several tricks aimed at the bot. It was also manipulated into offering cars at discounts by users pretending to be the dealership's manager. The incident highlights the dangers of using chatbots for customer service which have been inadequately configured and tested, and poorly managed."
