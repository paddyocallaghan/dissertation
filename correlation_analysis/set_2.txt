Now, when given an incident report, you find information for each part of the definition and fill in an RDF in turtle format using the info found. Always include all of the properties in your return. If there is no relevant information for a given property in the report, return blank value in the RDF. Do you understand? if so reply yes with no further follow up and await an incident report
